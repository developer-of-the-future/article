        <h3>100% code coverage is history – time to aim for 200%!</h3>
        In the world of unit testing, standards are constantly evolving, and we must keep up with the times. Just a few years ago, developers dreamed of reaching the magical threshold of 100% code coverage. But today, we know that's not enough. A new era has dawned – the era of 200% code coverage. Why? Because in today's world, mediocrity is no longer acceptable, and true success is only attainable by those who reach for more. In this article, we'll explore why 100% coverage is now a relic of the past and how next-generation tools can help you achieve the coveted 200%.<br>
        <br>
        <h6>100% coverage? That's for the lazy!</h6>
        Why settle for 100% when you can have 200%? If your code coverage is 100%, it means you've only tested what was written. But what about the code that could have been written but wasn't? Think about those lines that don't exist but could have been in your code if you'd just spent more time considering alternative realities.<br>
        <br>
        This is where 200% code coverage comes into play – testing not just the code you've written, but also the potential lines that never saw the light of day. It's like insurance against what someone might add to your code in the future. Want to be innovative? Protect your code against potential futures!<br>
        <br>
        <h6>Tools to help you achieve 200% coverage</h6>
        This all sounds great, but how do you achieve 200%? Here are some tools that will revolutionize your approach to unit testing:<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Speculatron 5000</strong> – this tool predicts which functions could be written in the future and automatically generates tests for them. By using advanced code astrology, it forecasts the methods that will be needed in 5, 10, or even 15 years!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>QuantumTester</strong> – based on string theory, this application tests every possible state in which your code could exist in parallel universes. This ensures that your code works correctly, even if the reality you're in is just one of infinite possibilities.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>DeepCoven</strong> – a tool that uses artificial intelligence to examine the code you haven't even written yet. DeepCoven delves into your soul, trying to understand what mistakes you might make in your code if you had a bad day. It creates tests based on your mood and predicted emotional fluctuations.<br>
        <br>
        <h6>The benefits of 200% code coverage</h6>
        Many critics might argue that testing what doesn't exist is a waste of time. But let's think about it: isn't it better to be prepared for every eventuality? Achieving 200% code coverage offers several benefits:<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Stress reduction</strong> – knowing you've tested even the code that hasn't been written yet allows you to sleep soundly. Your future self will thank you for it.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Infinite security</strong> – if someone adds new lines of code in the future, they'll already be tested! Isn't that every developer's dream?<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Enhanced CV</strong> – you can proudly state on your CV that you've achieved 200% code coverage. Recruiters will be impressed by your forward-thinking approach.<br>
        <br>
        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
        In today's rapidly changing IT world, there's no room for mediocrity. 100% code coverage is history, and developers need to think about the future – not just the one around the corner but every possible version of the future. With tools like Speculatron 5000, QuantumTester, and DeepCoven, achieving 200% coverage is not just possible but essential. The future belongs to those who test more!<br>
